Hi, I'm Edwin. I'm a business analytics leader, currently living in USA.  For more details about my work experience, visit my [Linkedin Page](http://www.linkedin.com/in/edwinf)

I am particularly passionate about rock-climbing, travelling and baking.  Many of my posts here will be on one of these topics.

I started rock-climbing when I was 14.  I mostly free-climb, since I'm not a huge fan of bouldering.  I train regularly at a climbing gym in Chicago and take occasional trips to Red River Gorge to climb.  My current goal is to send Cojon Prieto (7a) in Siurana, Spain.  

I love travelling and try to travel often.  I'm also fascinated with hotel and airline frequent flyer programs.  Most recently, I spent 2 months climbing in Spain.

Close friends know that I love to bake.  It's a dream of mine to open up a French bakery.  While you might not get to taste my creations (yet), I hope I can still share my baking experiences with you.
